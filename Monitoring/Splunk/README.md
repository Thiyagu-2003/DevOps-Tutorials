## 📊 Splunk Overview
> **DevOps Monitoring Tool | Log Analytics Platform**

Splunk is a log monitoring, searching, and analytics platform used to analyze machine-generated data in real time.

➡️ Primary Use Case:
Log Monitoring (not UI monitoring, not server management)

---

## 🔍 What is Splunk?
Splunk analyzes **machine-generated data** in real time.

Primary focus:
- ✅ Log monitoring
- ❌ UI testing
- ❌ Infrastructure provisioning

---

## 🧭 Types of Monitoring
Splunk supports:

- Application Monitoring
- Server Monitoring
- Network Monitoring
- **Log Monitoring** ✅ *(Primary use case)*

---

## 📝 What is a Log?
A log is a **time-stamped event record** generated by a system or application.

Common examples:
- User login / logout
- Application errors
- Server commands
- Network activity

Splunk supports:
- Keyword-based search
- SPL (Search Processing Language)

---

## 🧾 Events in Splunk
In Splunk, **one line in a log file is considered one event**.

Each event typically includes:
- Timestamp
- Host
- Source
- Message content

Example:
```text
2026-01-23 10:01:12 ERROR User login failed for user=admin
````

---

## 📂 Types of Logs

### Application Logs

* Business events
* Login activity
* Application errors

```text
application.log
```

### Server Logs

* OS activity
* EC2 login
* System commands

```text
/var/log/syslog
```

### Network Logs

* Firewall logs
* Load balancer logs
* Traffic flow

---

## 🚦 Log Levels

| Level | Meaning               |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| INFO  | Normal operation      |
| DEBUG | Debugging             |
| ERROR | Failures & exceptions |

---

## 🕒 Log Retention

Logs are stored only for a defined **retention period**.

Typical policies:

* 30 days
* 90 days

After retention:

* Logs are compressed
* Archived or deleted

---

## 📁 Log Paths

### Linux

```bash
/opt/<application>/log/application.log
/opt/<application>/log/application_13062021.log
```

### Windows

```text
C:\Application\Logs\
```

---

## 💰 Splunk Editions & Licensing

| Edition                   | Limit              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Splunk Enterprise (Trial) | 60 days            |
| Trial Daily Ingestion     | 500 MB/day         |
| Enterprise Licensed       | 100 GB/day or more |

⚠️ Splunk is not free for production use.

---

## 🏗 Splunk Architecture

Splunk uses a centralized architecture:

* Search Head – UI & queries
* Indexer – Stores indexed logs
* Forwarder – Sends logs from servers

---

## 🧩 Splunk Components

### Search Head

* User interface
* Runs SPL queries
* Dashboards & reports

### Indexer

* Indexes and stores logs
* Enables fast searching

### Forwarder

* Installed on servers (EC2)
* Sends logs to indexer

---

## 🔌 Ports Used by Splunk

| Purpose             | Port |
| ------------------- | ---- |
| Forwarder → Indexer | 9997 |
| Splunk Web UI       | 8000 |


---

## 🖥 Installation Steps (Linux)

### Step 1: Extract Splunk

```bash
tar -xvzf splunk-<version>.tgz
```

### Step 2: Navigate

```bash
cd splunk
cd bin
```

### Step 3: Start Splunk

```bash
./splunk start --accept-license
```

OR

```bash
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration: Master & Slave

### 🔹 Master Configuration

Enable listener on **9997**

```bash
/opt/splunk/bin
./splunk enable listen 9997
```

> Master should:

* Run **only Splunk**
* Not host other applications
* Can monitor **up to ~1000 servers**

---

### 🔹 Slave Configuration

Set master destination:

```bash
/opt/splunkforwarder/bin
./splunk add forward-server <MASTER_IP>:9997
```

Add log to monitor:

```bash
./splunk add monitor /var/log/syslog -index main
```

---

## ✅ Verification

Check Splunk process:

```bash
ps -ef | grep splunk
```

Same method as Jenkins verification.

---

## 🚨 Alerts vs 📄 Reports

### Alert

* Triggered only if condition matches
* Used for incidents
* Sends notification only when triggered

### Report

* Runs on schedule always
* Can send email even if no results
* Used for audit and compliance

---

## 🛠 Creating Alerts & Reports

### Step 1: Create Search

```spl
index=main "www.url.com" ERROR
```

### Step 2: Save as Report

* Save As → Report
* Set name and description

### Step 3: Schedule Report

* Edit → Schedule
* Set time (e.g., 9:00 AM)
* Enable email delivery

### Step 4: Create Alert

* Save As → Alert
* Condition: result count > 0
* Configure trigger & email

---

## 📊 Dashboard Creation

### Step 1: Run Search

```spl
index=main "www.url.com"
```

### Step 2: Create Visualization

* Go to Visualization tab
* Select chart:

  * Pie
  * Bar
  * Line
  * Table

### Step 3: Aggregate Data

```spl
index=main "www.url.com" | stats count by status
```

### Step 4: Save to Dashboard

* Save As → Dashboard Panel
* Add to new or existing dashboard

### Step 5: Multi-Panel Dashboard

Combine:

* Pie charts
* Bar charts
* Line graphs
* Tables

Similar to CloudWatch dashboards.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* One log line = One event
* Alert = Trigger-based
* Report = Schedule-based
* Dashboards = Visualization layer
* Forwarder → Indexer → Search Head
* Port 9997 is mandatory
